This report presents a comprehensive analysis of various machine learning models ap-
plied to weather prediction, specifically focusing on rain forecasting. We implement and
compare different algorithms including Linear Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), De-
cision Trees, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines (SVM). The analysis includes
data preprocessing, model training, evaluation metrics, and comparative analysis of model
performances.
